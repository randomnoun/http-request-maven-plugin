# http-request-maven-plugin

**http-request-maven-plugin**  is a maven plugin that performs a GET request.

It was written so that I could trigger a deployment at the end of the maven build process. 

## Why would anyone want to do that  ?

At the time I had a cgi-bin perl script that did the actual deploying, and this plugin would initiate that process. It was a bit like kubernetes, except it was vastly simpler and actually worked most of the time. 

## How do I use it
To be honest, not entirely sure any more. It's been about a decade since this thing was written and I can't find any projects that use it any more.

Will write something up one day I'm sure.
